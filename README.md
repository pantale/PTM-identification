# PTM identification program

These are the source files of the implementation of the software for the identification of the parameters of the PTM constitutive law related to the publication: 
Pierre Tize Mha, Amèvi Tongne and Olivier Pantalé. *A generalized non-linear flow law based on Modified Zerilli-Armstrong model and its implementation into Abaqus/Explicit FEM code*, 2022

## Usage of the software

All code is contained into the Jupyter notebook files `PTMcode.ipynb`  in the two subdirectories  `750-850` and `900-1300`.

The two python notebook files are almost the same except the number of curves to treat. Data is read from the provided excel files and the identified coefficients are available in the notebook outputs.
